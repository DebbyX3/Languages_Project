# Extension of Dynamic Semantics of a simple imperative language

This is the final project for the 'Programming Languages' course at the University of Verona, during the last year of bachelor's degree in Computer Science.
It extends the dynamic semantics of a simple imperative language with known iteration constructs: for, do while, if-then-elseif-else and the operator for a non-deterministic choice (random).
